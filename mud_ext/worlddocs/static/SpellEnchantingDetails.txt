---+ Spell Enchanting Details


All harmful spells in your spellbook may be used to enchant weapons, with the exception of spells that stun, sleep, fear or charm. The spell enchantment is treated like a poison application, with a limited amount of uses per enchantment and instant damage upon successful transfer to a mob.

Only crafted weapons, including bows (but no arrows) can be enchanted with a spell. To do so, put the weapon along with any kind of enchanting focus into the crafting window (even raw foci work for this, the focus won't be consumed) and then type '/enchant {spell name}' into your chatbox.

There is a limit of 2 such spell procs which can be active on a given weapon simultaneously. The spell used for the enchantment has to be known by the enchanter at least at level 3 (use tomes to increase it) and a weapon can only hold spells up to a specific level (not tome level this time), depending on the items level.

The chance for the spell proc to actually trigger in battle as well as the number of applications are both dependent on the player's Enchanting skill level, along with a little 'luck' modifier.

*%RED%Warning: %ENDCOLOR%* there is always a chance for failure when enchanting a weapon with a spell. Failure will trigger an explosion which hurts the player as well as the weapon. Higher Enchanting skill levels will lower the chance for failure, but failure will always remain a possibility. Spell components, mana and stamina costs have to be paid even if the enchantment fails.
